# RAG experiments

The objective is to study the ontology-building and matching capabilities of LLM models with the contribution of the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG). Each type of experiment is reported in separate pages:

* [Ontology building with RAG models](./ontology-building.md)
* [Data to ontology matching](./data-ontology.md)
