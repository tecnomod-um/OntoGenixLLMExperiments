# RAG experiments for matching data to ontologies

## Objective
 
Explore the capabilities of an RAG process using ontologies of interest and compare it to a baseline model that directly integrates this ontology into its prompt. The goal is to perform a CSV-Ontology Alignment, which involves providing the model with the ontologies to be used and attempting to find in those ontologies a class that matches each of the column names in the CSV file.

## The content of the RAG

In this experiment, the RAG consisted of the following ontologies:
* AFO ontology: The AFO is an ontology suite that provides a standard vocabulary and semantic model for the representation of laboratory analytical processes. 
* Country ontology (made by me): Describes the demographics, economics, and geography of a country.
* CHEMINF ontology: The chemical information ontology (cheminf) describes information entities about chemical entities. It provides qualitative and quantitative attributes to richly describe chemicals.

## GPT models
As in the other experiment, the RAG process is performed through an **assistant agent**. Assistants can call OpenAIâ€™s models with specific instructions to tune their personality and capabilities and can also access multiple tools in parallel, like the File Search tool. The **File Search tool** augments the Assistant with knowledge from outside its model, such as proprietary product information or documents provided by your users.

In this case, the assistant used the **GPT-4o model** and the previous three mentioned ontologies will be provided for the alignment task. So, when the model is asked to assign an IRI class to a column name of a CSV file, it will consult the ontologies previously included in a vector store.

### Evaluation of the RAG models
To evaluate the performance of the RAG models in the task of matching data to ontologies, four CSV files have been used.

TP: When the model proposes a correct IRI for the column name.

FP: When the model proposes an incorrect IRI for the column name.

TN: When the model indicates that an adequate IRI does not exist, it is real.

FN: When the model indicates that an adequate IRI does not exist, it is not real.


### Findings
* The ragged model can assign an adequate IRI to a column name using the classes of the ontologies of interest.
* The search can be limited to only those ontologies included in the RAG process, avoiding the use of other external ontologies.
* The RAG process via OpenAI API seems to underperform when the ontology included in the RAG is large. The larger the ontology, the more difficult it is for the model to interact with it.
