Please assign an IRI to each column in the provided CSV file. Each IRI should correspond to a class or an object property from the ontologies you know.
The CSV data is provided in JSON format, where each row is a key, and each key contains the column name and its corresponding value for that row.
To do the matching, the CSV file as JSON format and a description of the CSV file is given.
For each column name, search for an appropriate IRI from the ontologies.

**CSV file (in JSON format):**
{json_data}

**Description of the CSV file:**
{description}

Structure your output in the following format: <Column_name>: <IRI_selected>
If you consider that there is not an adequate identifier, then: <Column_name>: IRI not available.

Generate appropriate identifiers.
Do not explain your answer, just write the identifiers.
Do not write notes at the end of your writing.
