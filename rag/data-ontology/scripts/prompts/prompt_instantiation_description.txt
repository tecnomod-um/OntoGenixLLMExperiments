Please assign an IRI to each column in a CSV file, corresponding to a class from the ontologies stored in TTL format in your vector store.
The ontologies are available as text files named 'country.txt', 'afo.txt', and 'cheminf.txt'.
For each column name (listed in the first row of the CSV file), search through the ontologies sequentiallyâ€”starting with one and moving to the next if a suitable IRI is not found.
Continue until an appropriate IRI is identified for each column, or all three ontologies have been checked.
To do the matching, a description of the CSV file is given.
