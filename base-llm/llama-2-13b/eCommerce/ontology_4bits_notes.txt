Incorrect format and serialization (number of elements in the triples, and dots). Example:

 class class_entity {
   owl:ontology owl:version "1.0" .
   rdfs:subClassOf rdf:Resource .
   rdfs:label "Invoice" ;
       owl:oneOf ( "Country" "Description" "InvoiceDate" "InvoiceNo" "StockCode" "CustomerID" "Quantity" "UnitPrice" ) .
   rdfs:comment "An invoice is a document issued by a seller to a buyer for the sale and delivery of goods or services." .
   rdfs:domain "http://base_ontology.com/" .
   rdfs:range "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#, http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#, http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#" .
   owl:inverseOf "CustomerID" "Quantity" .
   owl:inverseOf "InvoiceDate" "InvoiceNo" .
   owl:inverseOf "StockCode" "Quantity" .
}
   
   
The use of owl:oneOf is not appropiate because limit the individuals.
owl:inverseOf can only be applied to object properties, and cannot be used with more than one value.
