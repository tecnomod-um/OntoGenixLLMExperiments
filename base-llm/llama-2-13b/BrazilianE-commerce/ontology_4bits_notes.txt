Incorrect format and serialization (number of elements, shortnames, dots, and wrong URIs). Example:

class class_entity {
 owl:ontologyProperty rdf:type owl:Class .
 owl:hasValue rdf:type owl:Class .
 owl:inverseOf rdf:type owl:Property .
 }
 
 Example of wrong URI: owl:ontologyProperty instead of owl:OntologyProperty. Some URIs are also used incorrectly.
