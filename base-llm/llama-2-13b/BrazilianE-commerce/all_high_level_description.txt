 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with synthesizing the JSON data and creating a schema description! Here's the synthesized description of the data, separated by possible relations with each of the classes to which they can be related:

Foundational Prefix: <https://base_ontology.com#, http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#, http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#, http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>

Data Description:

1. customer_city: text - short description of the column data meaning - possible range: A city where a customer is located.
	* Possible classes: class_entity, geo_entity.
2. customer_id: text - short description of the column data meaning - possible range: A unique identifier for a customer.
	* Possible classes: class_entity, entity_name.
3. customer_state: text - short description of the column data meaning - possible range: A state where a customer is located.
	* Possible classes: class_entity, geo_entity.
4. customer_unique_id: text - short description of the column data meaning - possible range: A unique identifier for a customer.
	* Possible classes: class_entity, entity_name.
5. customer_zip_code_prefix: numerical - short description of the column data meaning - possible range: A zip code prefix for a customer's location.
	* Possible classes: class_entity, geo_entity.

Classes:

1. class_entity: A class representing an entity with a unique identifier and a name.

Subclasses:

1. entity_name: A subclass of class_entity representing an entity with a name.

Object Properties:

1. class_entity:
	* domain: class_entity
	* range: entity_name
2. entity_name:
	* domain: entity_name
	* range: text

Data Type Properties:

1. class_entity:
	* domain: class_entity
	* range: owl:String
2. entity_name:
	* domain: entity_name
	* range: owl:String

Note that I have inferred the structure of the data based on the provided format and left ambiguous parts blank. I have also followed the guidelines provided and not added any descriptions or explanations outside the required format.
