Incorrect serialization due to the number of elements in the triples, and uncommented text. Examples:

 Sure, here is the thorough and exhaustive TURTLE syntax content for the proposed ontology, without condensing or shortening any part of it, ensuring strict compliance with the instructions provided:

<http://example.com/ontology/ProductReview/class_entity>
	owl:has_key owl:ObjectProperty <http://example.com/ontology/ProductReview/name> .
	
	
Some triples make no sense:
<http://example.com/ontology/ProductReview/entity_name>
a owl:SubClassOf .


Wrong URIs. Example: owl:SubClassOf instead of rdfs:subClassOf
