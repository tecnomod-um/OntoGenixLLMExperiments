Incorrect serialization due to the number of elements in the triples. Example:
<http://example.com/ontology/Passenger> owl:class <http://example.com/ontology/Age> "120"^^xsd:integer" .
<http://example.com/Flight> "10"^^xsd:integer" .


Loop at the end of the ontology:
<http/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/Flight/


Uncommented text: 
 Here is the TURTLE syntax for the proposed ontology


Used of owl:class instead of owl:Class, and used as property.
owl:hasValue used in an inappropriate way
