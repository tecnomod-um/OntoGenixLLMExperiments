 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with synthesizing the JSON data and creating an ontology from it!

**Foundational Prefix:**
Let's use the following foundational prefixes for the ontology:

* "https://base_ontology.com#"
* "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
* "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
* "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"

We'll define the ontology as an OWL type.

**Data Description:**
Here's the data description for each column in the JSON data:

1. "Country":
	* type: "text"
	* short description: The country where the invoice is issued.
	* possible range: A string representing a country.
2. "Description":
	* type: "text"
	* short description: A brief description of the invoice.
	* possible range: A string representing a brief description.
3. "InvoiceDate":
	* type: "text"
	* short description: The date the invoice was issued.
	* possible range: A string representing a date.
4. "InvoiceNo":
	* type: "text"
	* short description: The unique identifier for the invoice.
	* possible range: A string representing a unique identifier.
5. "StockCode":
	* type: "text"
	* short description: The stock code for the items in the invoice.
	* possible range: A string representing a stock code.
6. "CustomerID":
	* type: "Numerical"
	* short description: The unique identifier for the customer.
	* possible range: A numerical value representing a customer ID.
7. "Quantity":
	* type: "Numerical"
	* short description: The quantity of items in the invoice.
	* possible range: A numerical value representing a quantity.
8. "UnitPrice":
	* type: "Numerical"
	* short description: The unit price of the items in the invoice.
	* possible range: A numerical value representing a unit price.

**Classes:**
Here are the classes in the ontology:

1. class_entity

**Subclasses:**
Here are the subclasses of class_entity:

1. entity_name: subclass of -> class_entity

**Object Properties:**
Here are the object properties for each class and subclass:

1. class_entity:
	* object_property_name: "name"
		+ domain: class_entity
		+ range: "https://base_ontology.com#text"
2. entity_name:
	* object_property_name: "name"
		+ domain: entity_name
		+ range: "https://base_ontology.com#text"

**Data Type Properties:**
Here are the data type properties for each class and subclass:

1. class_entity:
	* data_property_name: "description"
		+ domain: class_entity
		+ range: "https://base_ontology.com#text"
2. entity_name:
	* data_property_name: "stockCode"
		+ domain: entity_name
		+ range: "https://base_ontology.com#text"
