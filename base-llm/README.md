# Experiments with base openLLMs

This page reports the process followed and the results obtained for each openLLLM in the use of the OntoGenix prompts with their base models.


## Experiments by openLLM

For each LLM we must report in the README.md file: work done to set to be able to use the LLM; adaptation of the OntoGenix prompts; link to the result obtained; analysis of the result and the process (without ontology quality analysis which will come later)
