# OntoGenixOpenSourceLLM
This repository describes and reports the results obtained by applying the OntoGenix pipeline with open source large language models (openLLMs).

## openLLMs used
* [Llama-2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b): 7B and 70B
* [Llama-3](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3): 8B and 70B
* [Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/mixtral): base and 7B

## Experiments 

The experiments consisted on generating ontologies from the Kaggle Datasets used in the [original experiments with OpenAI GPT](https://github.com/tecnomod-um/OntoGenixEvaluation).

Therefore, each experiment with a particular configuration of an OpenLLM consisted in generating an ontology from one of those datasets

The result of the different LLM's outputs can be found in its correspondent subfolder.
