Ontology without syntax errors, but semantics errors. For example, schema:identifier is a property, but class entity is declarated as subClassOf this property:
```
base:ComplaintID a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf schema:identifier .
```

Also wrong URIs, like schema:PostalCode, that does not exist.
