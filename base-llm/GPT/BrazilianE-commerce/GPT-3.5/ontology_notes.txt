Ontology without syntax errors, but semantic errors. For example, Datatype properties declarated as Object properties:
```
entity_customer:hasCustomerCity a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain entity_customer: ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string .
```

Also wrong URIs. Example: entity_customer:hasCustomerCity.
