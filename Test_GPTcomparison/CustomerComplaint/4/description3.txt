To enhance the interoperability of the ontology schema, we will link the entities to well-known external vocabularies and ontologies. This will allow systems that understand these external resources to better interpret the data described by our ontology.

**Ontology Prefixes:**
We will use the Turtle format to define the prefixes for the external vocabularies:

```
@prefix base: <https://base_ontology.com#> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix gr: <http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#> .
@prefix vcard: <http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#> .
```
