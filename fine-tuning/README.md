# Fine-tuning experiments

The objective is to study the ontology-building and ontology population capabilities of fine-tuned LLM models, where a base LLM is trained on new, targeted data, allowing it to adapt effectively to a specific context. Each type of experiment is reported in separate pages:

* [Ontology building with fine-tuned models](./ontology-building.md)
* [Ontology population with fine-tuned models](./ontology-building.md)
