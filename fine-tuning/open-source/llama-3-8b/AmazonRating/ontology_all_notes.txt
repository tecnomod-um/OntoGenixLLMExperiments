Missing end dots at the end of "Classes" and "Datatype properties" sections. Example:

um:Timestamp rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Timestamp" 
	

There are object properties that have more than one entity as domain, but with "and" operator instead of "or". 
Example: hasTimestamp (Review and Timestamp as domain, Timestamp as range).
