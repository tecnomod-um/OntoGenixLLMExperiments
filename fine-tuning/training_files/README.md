# üìÅ Datasets for Ontology Construction from CSV Files

This directory contains a collection of datasets used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for the task of **automatic ontology construction** from structured tabular data. These datasets span various domains and contexts of sales data, enabling the model to generalize and infer conceptual structures from CSV schemas.

The primary objective of this data collection is to train models that can semantically interpret CSV files and output ontological representations ‚Äî e.g., class hierarchies, object properties, and data types ‚Äî suitable for knowledge graph construction, semantic web tasks, or downstream reasoning applications.
