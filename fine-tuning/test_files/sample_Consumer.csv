FTC complaint has been filed against XXXX for falsely reporting a deficiency I do not owe. 
FTC complaint number is XXXX. I also wrote my state attorney General concerning this matter and I await the outcome from that as well as the FTC complaint. My last letter to Equifax was ignored and nothing I asked for was provided or addressed. Equifax said they verified the account is mine when I did not ask if it was mine or not. I am disputing their right to report that I have this balance with XXXX when by law I do not owe XXXX. By Law, this debt is considered Null and void and should be removed immediately. Equifax should not be aiding XXXX in breaking the laws of the State of New York and violating my rights as a consumer. Here is the complaint filed against XXXX with the FTC. 

I will be filing one against Equifax as well by XX/XX/XXXX if this is not removed from my credit reports. Complaint sent to FTC -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- To : Federal Trade Commision cc : New York State Attorney General On XX/XX/XXXX I mailed a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX inquiring about a deficiency they are reporting to the three major credit Bureaus in the amount of {$6700.00}. Under the laws of the State of New York UCC 9.506 and State RISA and MVISA statutes a deficiency can not be claimed unless all the required notices were properly and timely given, and all of the allowable redemption and cure time limits were adhered to XXXX XXXX Responded to me by sending a copy of the original contract which had my address at the time of this vehicle purchase and also the 3 notices they were supposed to send by law in a PROPER AND TIMELY MANNER.. All of these notices have a different address from the address on the original contract. An address at which I never resided, neither did I provide this address to XXXX  XXXX ( not sure how they came by this address ) the mail they sent to the address I assume must have been returned to them. ( XXXX XXXX ) This address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX Clearly, these notices were not properly and timely given, and all of the allowable redemption and cure time limits were not adhered to. I sent another letter to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX certified mail return receipt. A proper notice with proof of delivery. I got the stamped green card back in the mail showing they received my second letter on XX/XX/XXXX. USPS tracking ( XXXX ) In this letter I pointed out to XXXX XXXX that the address to which they allegedly sent this notice is not mine and it doesnt match the address on the contract thus the claim of owed deficiency is invalid under the law. XXXX XXXX has not responded to my second letter. Please remove this deficiency from my credit reports because under the law I do not owe it since I was not notified properly and timely notified by XXXX XXXX I have never lived at that particular address and have never asked for any communication to be sent to me via mail to that address. Due to the fact that XXXX  XXXX XXXX failed to send the legal notices to my proper address and in a timely manner, under the laws of the State of New York UCC 9.506 and State RISA and MVISA statutes a deficiency can not be claimed The notices were not properly and timely served because there is no way I would have ever seen any notices sent to an address I do not nor have I ever resided. The alleged claim of a deficiency is to be considered null and void, and any continued collection activities or continued reporting of this invalid claim on my credit reports will be considered a violation of the FDCPA and FCRA.

2019-03-05,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I received an XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX ( see attachments ) saying there is {$310.00} shortage amount on my loan and that divided by 12 months, there will be an increase of {$26.00} to my monthly mortgage payment. Then I received another letter on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attachment ) showing the shortage to be {$410.00}. 
As a background, my loan originated XX/XX/XXXX and I have been paying a {$100.00} Escrow payment towards PMI. I do not currently have an impound account. Per my amortization schedule, the PMI is to remain static until I reach the 80 % debt to loan ratio. Also, as of XX/XX/XXXX my loan was transferred to a new servicer. 
I contacted the new servicer on several occasions to understand what the shortage payment is for and they weren't able to help me because they are saying they don't see any transaction history prior to XXXX. Two supervisors ( XXXX and XXXX ) requested the transaction history from the old servicer and haven't received the document. They are claiming they are just collecting this amount on behalf of the old servicer and have nothing to do with it. 
I've also been in contact with the old servicer and they are also saying they don't know why there is a shortage payment. No one is able to help me and this is my last resort to get this issue resolved. I have made my mortgage payments on time every month since the origination of my loan and I don't understand why there is a shortage payment and why I would be the one responsible for that when I pay what I owe every month. I am not in control of when and how much money goes in and out of the escrow account, and I shouldn't be punished for it. I feel I am being given the run around by both servicers. No one is able to help me and I'm reaching out to you.
