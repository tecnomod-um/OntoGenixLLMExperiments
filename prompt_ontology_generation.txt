For the next dataset description: {dataset_description}, I need you to translate the dataset related to commercial activities to an ontology using the RDF, XML, XSD, RDFS, and OWL ontologies formatted as TTL.                    
Try to differentiate between concepts (Classes) and attributes (Data properties). 
Use the prefix um: with IRI <https://vocab.um.es> for any created entities. 
Do not write any explanation at the beginning or the end of the answer.                   
Not include individuals in the ontology.
